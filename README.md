# spiraling_complexity

A model of sequence divergence on a holey fitness landscape based on RNA folding to simulate the accumulation of Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities. For more information see https://doi.org/10.1101/076232.

Contains the following files:

+ RNA_folding_model.py: The model written in Python.

+ RNA folding model demo.ipynb: An ipython notebook showing RNA_folding_model.py in action.  

+ Ref_seqs.txt: A list of 1000 reference sequences (FASTA format) used in our paper.
